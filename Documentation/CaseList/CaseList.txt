n=150 homogeneous samples are taken from 0 to 8.5 are used to create an array of bulk Reynolds number to test.

The formula used is Reb=100*2^s for every s in the sample array. 

This parameter study evaluates the non-dimensional velocity profiles of channel flow at differnt turbulence levels. 

The output is a 3d plot that is exported into an stl file to 3D print :-)
